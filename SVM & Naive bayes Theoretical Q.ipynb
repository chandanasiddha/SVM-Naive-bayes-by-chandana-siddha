    "   \\[\n",
    "   \\frac{2}{||w||}\n",
    "   \\]\n",
    "   A larger margin improves generalization.\n",

    "**Laplace Smoothing** is a technique used in **Naïve Bayes classification** to handle the **zero probability problem** that occurs when a word or feature is missing in the training data but appears in the test data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Why is it needed?**\n",
    "- In Naïve Bayes, probabilities are calculated based on feature occurrences.\n",
    "- If a feature **never appears** in the training data for a class, its probability becomes **zero**, which can cause incorrect predictions.\n",
    "- Laplace Smoothing **adjusts probabilities** to prevent zero values.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Mathematical Formula:**\n",
    "Laplace Smoothing modifies the probability estimation as follows:\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "P(x|C) = \\frac{(count(x) + \\alpha)}{(total count + \\alpha \\cdot N)}\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- \\( \\alpha \\) is the **smoothing parameter** (typically set to 1).\n",
    "- \\( N \\) is the **number of possible feature values**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Effects of Laplace Smoothing:**\n",
    "- Ensures that **every feature has a nonzero probability**.\n",
    "- Helps in **handling unseen words** in text classification.\n",
    "- Prevents **overconfidence in probability estimates**.\n"
